# CarbonSense

Carbon sense is a full stack MERN app designed to help users reduce their carbon footprint
through daily tracking of 10 predetermined categories.  Users are encouraged to log their daily 
activities and attempt to keep their score below a certain threshold.

The leaderboard allows users to compete against one another and vie for the title of most eco-friendly.

If you'd like to try out CarbonSense it's currently deployed on Heroku at:
